# TOP Javascript Course Project - CV Maker

04/14/2022 ~ 04/18/2022

## Objectives

Using react.js, create a simple site that allows users to create a resume.

The site must include the following:

- Use class components (These components will be changed to functional ones in a later lesson)
- Your resume should include the following editable sections:
  - General information (Name, e-mail)
  - Educational experience
  - Practical experience (previous companies)

## Learnings

Really enjoy JSX and the way that components are setup.
